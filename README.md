# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems.  Within the named folders are solutions using that language.

##  Purpose

This repository serves as a personal collection of my LeetCode solutions. I use LeetCode to:

* Improve my problem-solving skills
* Practice data structures and algorithms
* Prepare for technical interviews

##  Organization

The repository is organized by language followed by LeetCode problem number and title.
```
leetcode/
├── go
├──── 1768_merge_strings/
├────── solution.go
├────── solution_test.go
├────── README.md
``` 

* Each problem has its own directory (e.g., `0001_two_sum`).
* Inside each problem directory:
    * `solution.xxx`: Contains the code solution.
    * `README.md`: May contain a problem description or other notes.

##  Contributions

This is my personal repository for tracking my LeetCode progress. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue.

##  Disclaimer

These solutions are for learning purposes. There might be better or more efficient ways to solve some of these problems and I am welcome to constructive criticism.
